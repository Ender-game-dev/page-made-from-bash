  <title>Web Page Made With Bash</title>

  <h1>Welcome to the page I took the most time at making</h1>

    <section class="text"><p>What is the purpose of this page you may ask:</p>
      <p>Im sorry to dissapoint you, this page has no purpose... At all... I just learned how to use the bash command line, I learned that you can edit files from there so I said to myself "Hey! What if I make a web page completely from the command line?" And that is what I did, and that is what I am regreting right now lol</p>
      <p>Alright! Come with me to see how the number of different things I attempt on doing from the command line (Be aware that if something I say does not work, it is because I just could not do it, or took way more time of what I initially expected to spend working on this project hehe)</p>
